1 - I am building a Mood Journal app with Expo Router v4, Supabase, Zustand, TypeScript, Nativewind, and AI features. Act as my senior engineer. Generate a step-by-step plan, folder structure, required screens, required files, and ask me which part to scaffold next. Follow Expo Router v4 conventions. Keep code modular. Wait for my confirmation before generating code.
A - 'll help you build this Mood Journal app! Before I create a comprehensive plan, I need to clarify a few critical aspects:
What AI features do you want in the app?
a) Sentiment analysis of journal entries + mood insights/trends
b) AI chat companion to discuss feelings
c) Both sentiment analysis and AI chat
d) Just basic mood tracking (add AI later)
What authentication methods should I include?
a) Email/Password only
b) Email/Password + Social OAuth (Google/Apple)
c) Magic link (passwordless email)
What are the core screens/features you need?
a) Add mood entry, view history, basic stats
b) Add entry, calendar view, detailed analytics, mood trends
c) Full featured: entry CRUD, calendar, analytics, insights, settings, export data
Please answer with the letter choices (e.g., "1a, 2b, 3c") so I can create a tailored plan for your needs.
